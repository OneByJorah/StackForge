## Overview

StackDeploy is a Docker Compose-based self-hosted stack for Hermes Agents. It consolidates local web search, long-term memory, browser automation, vector storage, and Obsidian note-taking into a reproducible, one-command deployment. The stack is designed to run on CPU-only hosts with no local GPU, while keeping the LLM layer intentionally external so you can plug in free cloud providers.

Bundled integrations:
- **browser-search**: SearXNG + Camofox + CloakBrowser for search and protected-site browsing
- **obsidian-skills**: Agent skills for Obsidian Markdown, Bases, JSON Canvas, CLI, and Defuddle extraction

Secrets and environment configuration are managed via `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`, never committed to version control.

---

## Architecture

Client → Hermes Agent → Local services (SearXNG, Camofox, Qdrant, Obsidian, PostgreSQL + Redis) → optional upstream LLM provider via Hermes config.

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+) |
| Primary Stack | Docker Compose / Bash |
| VCS | Git + GitHub (`github.com/OneByJorah/StackDeploy`) |
| Memory / Context | Honcho |
| Notifications | Telegram (J1-bot) |
| Release path | `git push origin main` (documentation/build on branch) |

---

## Features

- **SearXNG**: privacy-respecting self-hosted web search.
- **Camofox**: browser navigation via REST API for standard sites.
- **CloakBrowser**: stealth browser fallback for anti-bot protected sites.
- **Honcho API**: long-term memory and workspace context for Hermes.
- **Qdrant**: vector storage for semantic retrieval.
- **Obsidian vault**: markdown-backed note-taking exposed via web UI.
- **Obsidian Skills**: agent-ready skills for Markdown, Bases, Canvas, CLI, and Defuddle extraction.
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis**: durable memory backend with vector support.
- **One-command bootstrap**: clone, env, stack, init, healthcheck.
- **Extensible service-based design**: add modules via Compose blocks.
- **CPU-first design**: no local GPU required for base stack.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OneByJorah/StackDeploy.git
cd StackDeploy

# 2. Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set SERVER_IP, HONCHO_TOKEN, HONCHO_DB_PASSWORD

# 3. Start the stack
docker compose up -d
./scripts/init-honcho.sh
./scripts/init-obsidian.sh
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_IP` | Tailscale or local IP used in docs/examples | Required |
| `HONCHO_TOKEN` | Auth token for Honcho API | Optional |
| `HONCHO_DB_PASSWORD` | Postgres password for Honcho backend | Required |
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` | Host path for the Obsidian vault | Optional |

Keep `.env` out of VCS. Prefer `.env.example` placeholders in docs.

---

## Service Management

```bash
# Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# Stop
docker compose down

# Tail logs
docker compose logs -f

# Healthcheck
./scripts/healthcheck.sh <server-ip>
```

## Browser-search

Self-hosted search and browsing via SearXNG, Camofox, and CloakBrowser.

**Endpoints**

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SearXNG | `8080` | JSON API: `/search?format=json&q=<query>` |
| Camofox | `9377` | REST API: `/docs` for Swagger UI |

**Setup**

```bash
cd browser-search
npm install
```

Optional: run Camofox with auth keys in `.env`:
```bash
camofox_api_key=... camofox_admin_key=... docker compose up -d
```

CloakBrowser is included as npm scripts:
```bash
node scripts/cloak/cloak-fetch.mjs "https://example.com"
```

## Obsidian Skills

Agent-readable skills for working with Obsidian vaults.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `obsidian-markdown` | Create/edit Obsidian Flavored Markdown |
| `obsidian-bases` | Create/edit `.base` views and filters |
| `json-canvas` | Create/edit `.canvas` mind maps |
| `obsidian-cli` | Interact with vault via `obsidian` CLI |
| `defuddle` | Extract clean markdown from URLs |

These skills are available at `obsidian-skills/skills/`. If your agent loads skills from a directory, point it there. For Obsidian CLI, ensure the desktop app is installed and accessible on the host.

## CI/CD & Deployment

- Branch model: `main` for stable, feature branches for work-in-progress.
- Use `git push origin <branch>` to publish changes and trigger downstream automation.
- Keep Cheatsheet/docs in sync before merging: docs, README, and any changed service ports/endpoints.

---

## Security

- Secrets are handled through `.env` files with restrictive permissions; never store raw API tokens in README or source.
- Frontend artifacts and dashboard access paths are not credential-based in this repository.
- Services expose ports on localhost / trusted interfaces by default; bind only to trusted networks in production.
